# Game Station

This is the code for my Game Station project, which is a game console enabling players to play 5 interactive games. It is built using the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 and uses an Alexa powered Echo device to provide voice interaction.

There are two components to the code. The node.js Alexa Skill code, which manages the Alexa side of things, and the ev3dev code which runs on the EV3 brick and manages the EV3 side of things.
